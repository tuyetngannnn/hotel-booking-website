# 🏨 Hotel Booking Management

## 📌 Project Overview  

Hotel Booking Management is a web-based system designed to help hotels efficiently manage key operations such as room reservations, service bookings, customer profiles, and revenue tracking.

Customers can easily check room availability, make reservations, add extra services, and complete payments online. Meanwhile, hotel staff can manage booking schedules, access customer records, and monitor business performance through a user-friendly interface.

The system also provides an admin dashboard to oversee all activities — from the number of booked rooms and daily revenue to detailed customer information — all in one platform. It streamlines hotel operations and enhances the overall experience for both staff and guests.
